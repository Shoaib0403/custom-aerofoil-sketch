# Custom Airfoil Sketch 

This repository contains a custom manually sketched airfoil created in Autodesk Fusion 360.  
The airfoil was drawn from scratch to practice CAD modeling skills relevant to aerospace engineering.

## Project Contents
- airfoil(aerofoil).pdf → Exported drawing of the airfoil (2D view).  
- LICENSE → Open-source MIT license.  

## Purpose
This project was created as part of my MSc Aerospace Engineering practice.  
It focuses on learning:
- Manual sketching of aerodynamic profiles  
- Using Fusion 360 for 3D modeling
